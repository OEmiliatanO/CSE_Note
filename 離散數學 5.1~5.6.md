## 5.1
> __Cartesian Products__: for sets $A$, $B$ the _Cartesian Products_, or _cross product_, of $A$ and $B$ is denoted by $A \times B$ and equal $\{(a, b) | a \in A, b \in B\}$
> __relation__: for sets $A$, $B$, any subset of $A \times B$ is called a (binary) relation from $A$ to $B$. Any subset of $A \times A$ is called a (binary) relation on A

3. for $A=\{1,2,3\}$, and $B=\{2,4,5\}$, determine the following:
(a). $|A\times B|$
(b). the number of relations from $A$ to $B$
\(c\). the number of relations on $A$
(d). the number of relations from $A$ to $B$ that contain $(1,2)$ and $(1,5)$
(e). the number of relations from $A$ to $B$ that contain exactly five __ordered pairs__
(f). the number of relations on $A$ that contain at least seven elements

ans:
(a). $9$
(b). $2^9$
\(c\). $2^9$
(d). $2^7$
(e). $C^9_5$
(f). $C^9_7+C^9_8+C^9_9$

4. for which sets $A$, $B$ is it true that $A\times B = B \times A$?

ans: ($A$ or $B$ is emptyset or both are) $\lor$ ($A=B$ )

5. let $A, B, C, D$ be nonempty sets.
(a). prove that $A\times B \subseteq C \times D$ iff $A\subseteq C$ and $B\subseteq D$
(b). what happens to the result in part (a) if any of the sets $A, B, C, D$ is empty?

ans:
assume $a \in A,b \in B$. because pair $(a,b) \in A \times B \subseteq C \times D$, $(a,b) \in C \times D$, which suggests $a\in C$ and $b \in D$.
$a$ can be any elements in $A$, so can $b$ be any elements in $B$, which imply $A \subseteq C, B\subseteq D$.
Q.E.D.

when any of them is empty set, still can know that $A\subseteq C$ and $B\subseteq D$ $\Rightarrow$ $A\times B \subseteq C \times D$, but the contrary is not.

7. if $A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and $B = \{w,x,y,z\}$, how many elements are there in $\mathscr P(A \times B)$

ans: $2^{20}$

11. for $A, B, C \subseteq \mathscr U$, prove that $A \times (B - C)=(A \times B) - (A \times C)$

ans: $(x,y)\in A\times(B-C)\iff x\in A \land y\in B-C\iff x\in A \land y\in B\land y\notin C$
$\iff (x,y)\in A\times B\land (x,y)\notin A\times C\iff (x,y) \in A\times B-A\times C$

## 5.2
> __function__: for nonempty sets $A$, $B$, a _function_, or _mapping_, $f$ from $A$ to $B$, denoted $f:A\to B$, is a relation from $A$ to $B$ in which every element of $A$ __appears exactly once__ as the first component of an ordered pair in the relation.
> for $(a, b) \in f$, $b$ is called the _image_ of $a$ under $f$, whereas $a$ is _preimage_ of $b$.
> ! so function is a kind of relation with stricter condition.
> __domain, codomain, range__: for the function $f:A \to B$, $A$ is the _domain_ of $f$ and $B$ the codomain of $f$. the subset of $B$ consisting of those elements that appear as second components in the ordered pairs of $f$ is called the _range_ of $f$, which is actually the set of images under $f$.
> __one-to-one(injective)__: A function $f:A \to B$ is called _one-to-one_, or _injective_, if each element of $B$ appears at most once as the image of an element of $A$.
> __restriction, extension__: let $A_1 \subseteq A$, then $f|_{A_1}:A_1\to B$ is called the _restriction_ of $f$ to $A_1$ if $f|_{A_1}(a) = f(a), \forall a \in A$. 
> if $g:A \to B$ and $g(a) = f(a), \forall a \in A_1$, then we call $g$ an _extension_ of $f$ to $A$.

if $q \geq \frac12$, $\lfloor n + q + \frac12 \rfloor = n + 1$, and $\lfloor 2n + 2q \rfloor =2n + 1$, the equtaion can be rewrite to $n  + n + 1 = 2n + 1$, which any real number can satisfy.

if $q < \frac12$, the equation can be rewrite to $n + n = 2n$, which any real number can satisfy.

(b). yes, range = $\{2x + 1 | x \in \mathbb Q\} = \mathbb Q$

(b). how many functions are there from $B$ to $A$? how many of these are onto? how many are one-to-one?

ans:
(a). $6^4$, $\frac{6!}{2!}$, $\sum_{k = 0}^{6}(-1)^k C^{6}_{6-k} (6-k)^4=0$ which may imply the formula of counting onto function is always zero when $|B| > |A|$
>extra: prove that $n! \times S(m,n)$ is always zero when $n > m$
>ans: 
>we know $S(0, n) = S(n, 0) = 0$, and $S(m + 1, n) = S(m, n - 1) + nS(m, n)$.
>$S(1, 2) = S(0, 1) + 2 \times S(0, 2) = 0$, $S(1, k) = S(0, k - 1) + k \times S(0, k) = 0, k > 1$, $S(2, k) = S(1, k - 1) + k \times S(1, k) = 0, k > 2$,...$S(m, k) = S(m - 1, k - 1) + kS(m - 1, k) = 0, k > m$ Q.E.D.

(b).$4^6$, $4!S(6, 4)$, $0$ ($\frac{4!}{(4-6)!} = \frac{4!}{\Gamma(-1)} = \frac{4!}{-\infty} = 0$)

5. verify that $\sum_{k = 0}^n (-1)^k C^n_{n - k} (n - k)^m = 0$ for $n = 5$, and $m = 2, 3, 4$

ans: the formula is the same as n! times Stirling number of second kind denoted $n! \times S(m, n)$. as definition, $S(0, n) = S(m, 0) = 0$, and $S(m + 1, n) = S(m, n - 1) + nS(m, n)$. based on this,
$S(1, k) = S(0, k - 1) + k\times S(0, k) = 0, k > 1$, $S(2, k) = S(1, k - 1) + k\times S(1, k) = 0, k > 2$,
and so on..., $S(m, k) = S(m - 1, k - 1) + kS(m - 1, k), k > m$.
and that prove $S(m, n) = 0$ when $n > m$.

6. (b). provide a combinatorial argument to that for all $m, n \in \mathbb Z^+$, $m^n = \sum^{m}_{i = 1} C^m_i \times i! \times S(n, i)$

ans: assume sets $A$, $B$, $B_i$, and $|A| = n, |B| = m$, $B_i \subseteq B$ and $|B_i| = i$. 
we can notice that $i! \times S(n, i)$ means the number of onto function from $A$ to $B_i$.
$C^m_i \times i! \times S(n, i)$ means how many onto functions are there from $A$ to every subset of $B$ whose cardinality is $i$. and as we add up all of them from $i=1$ to $i=m$, we get the number of functions from $A$ to $B$ which is $m^n$.

7. (a). let $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ,6, 7\}$ and $B = \{v, w, x, y, z\}$. determine the number of functions $f: A \to B$ where

ans:
a. i: $2!S(7, 2)$
a. ii: $C^5_2 \times 2! \times S(7, 2)$
a. iii: $3!S(7, 3)$
a. iv: $C^5_3 \times 3! \times S(7, 3)$
a. v: $4!S(7, 4)$

(b). $C^n_k \times k! \times S(m, k)$

9. is $f(x) = x^5 -2x^2 + x$ an one-to-one function?

ans: no. since $f(x) = x(x - 1)(x^3 + x^2 + x - 1)$, $f(0) = f(1) = 0$

> __the pigeonhole principle__: if $m$ pigeon occupy $n$ pigeonholes and $m > n$, then at least one pigeon has two or more pigeons roosting in it.
> 
__EXAMPLE__: prove that if $101$ integers are selected from the set $S = \{1, 2, 3, ..., 200\}$, then there are two integers such that one divides the other.
ans: for each $x\in S$, $x$ can be rewritten to $x=2^ky,k\geq 0$ . $y \in T=\{1, 3, 5, ..., 199\}$ and $|T| = 100$. since we select $101$ integers, there must be a repeated element $Y$. assume the two elements we select are $A=2^aY$, $B=2^bY$, say $a < b$, then $A|B$.
Q.E.D.

__EXAMPLE__: prove that for each $n \in \mathbb Z^+$, a sequence of $n^2 + 1$ distinct real numbers contains a decreasing or increasing subsequence of length $n + 1$ .
ans: let $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n^2 + 1}$ be the sequence of $n^2 + 1$ distinct real numbers. for $1\leq k \leq n^2 + 1$, let
$x_k$ = the maximum length of a decreasing subsequence that ends with $a_k$
$y_k$ = the maximum length of a increasing subsequence that ends with $a_k$

if there's no decreasing/increasing subsequence of length $n + 1$, then $1\leq x_k \leq n$ and $1\leq y_k\leq n$ for all $1 \leq k \leq n^2+1$. consequently, there are at most $n^2$ distinct ordered pairs $(x_k, y_k)$. but we have $n^2 + 1$ ordered pairs $(x_k, y_k)$. the pigeonhole principle imply that there must be two identical ordered pairs $(x_i, y_i), (x_j, y_j),i\neq j$, say $i < j$.
if $a_i < a_j$, then $y_i < y_j$. while if $a_i > a_j$, then $x_i > x_j$.
this contradiction tells us that $x_k=n + 1$ or $y_k=n+1$ for some $n + 1 \leq k \leq n^2+1$.

3. how many seats must be occupied to guarantee that at least two people seated in the auditorium have the same first and last initials?

ans: $26^2+1$

4. let $S = \{3, 7, 11, 15, 19, ..., 95, 99, 103\}$. how many (distinct) elements must we select from $S$ to insure that there will be at least two whose sum is $110$?

ans: there are $12$ sets whose sum are $110$: $\{7, 103\}, \{11, 99\}, ..., \{51, 59\}$ and $2$ rest sets $\{3\}, \{55\}$. so if we want to ensure that there will be at least two elements whose sum is $110$, we need to pick at least $15$ elements

5. (a). prove that if $151$ integers are selected from $\{1, 2, 3, ..., 300\}$, then the selection must include two integers $x, y$ where $x|y$ or $y|x$

ans:
(a). the element $x$ in the set can be rewritten to $x =2^ky, \space k \geq 0$ and $y$ is odd.
and the set made from $y$ is $\{1, 3, 5, 7...\}$ with its cardinality is $150$. if we pick $151$ elements, there must be at least $2$ repeated elements $A=2^ay, B=2^by$, say $a < b$, then $A|B$.
Q.E.D.

6. prove that if we select $101$ integers from the set $S= \{1, 2, 3, ..., 200\}$, there exist $m,\space n$ in the selection where $gcd(m,n) = 1$

ans: $S$ can be separated to two sets $\{1, 3, 5, ..., 199\}$, $\{2, 4, 6, ..., 200\}$. select $101$ element from this two sets, there must be two number $n, n+1$, and we know $gcd(n, n+1)=1$.
Q.E.D.

8. (a). if $S\subseteq \mathbb Z^+$ and $|S| \geq3$, prove that there exist distinct $x,y\in S$ where $x+y$ is even.
(b). let $S \subseteq \mathbb Z^+ \times \mathbb Z^+$. find the minimal value of $|S|$ that guarantees the existence of distinct ordered pairs $(x_1, x_2), (y_1, y_2)\in S$ such that $x_1+y_1$ and $x_2+y_2$ are both even.
\(c\). extending the ideas in part(a) and (b), consider $S\subseteq \mathbb Z^+ \times \mathbb Z^+ \times \mathbb Z^+$. what size must $|S|$ be to guarantee the existence of the distinct ordered triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3), (y_1, y_2, y_3)\in S$ where $x_1+y_1$, $x_2+y_2$, $x_3+y_3$ are all even?
(d). generalize the results of part(a), (b), \(c\).
(e). a point $P(x, y)$ in the Cartesian plan is called a _lattice point_ if $x,y \in \mathbb Z$. given distinct lattice points $P_1(x_1, y_1), P_2(x_2, y_2), ..., P_n(x_n, y_n)$, determine the smallest value of $n$ that guarantees the existence of $P_i(x_i, y_i), P_j(x_j, y_j), 1 \leq i < j \leq n$, such that the midpoint of the line segment connecting $P_i(x_i, y_i)$ and $P_j(x_j, y_j)$ is also a lattice point.

ans:
let $0$ represents even number, $1$ represents odd number.
(a). at least need $3$ numbers to guarantee $2$ distinct number add up is even.
(b). let pair $(o, e)$ be $(x_i \space (mod \space 2), y_i \space (mod \space 2))$, all the combinations are $(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)$. we can find that only when one of them appears twice, the condition can be satisified.
so the sets need at least $5$ elements.
\(c\). $2^3+1$
