## 14.1
> __ring__: let $R$ be a nonempty set on which have two closed binary operations, denoted by $+$ and $\cdot$. then $(R,+,\cdot)$ is a _ring_ if for all $a,b,c\in R$, the following conditions are satisf
> (a) commutative law of $+$ : $a+b=b+a$
> (b) associative law of $+$ : $a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$
> \(c\) existence of an identity for $+$ : there exists $z\in R$ such that $a+z=z+a=a,\,\forall a\in R$
> (d) existence of inverse under $+$ : for each $a\in R$ there is an element $b\in R$ with $a+b=b+a=z$
> (e) associative law of $\cdot$ : $a\cdot(b\cdot c)=(a\cdot b)\cdot c$
> (f) distributive law of $\cdot$ over $+$ : $a\cdot(b+c)=a\cdot b+a\cdot c$ and $(b+c)\cdot a=b\cdot a+c\cdot a$
> __commutative ring__: let $(R,+,\cdot)$ be a ring. if $ab=ba,\,\forall a,b\in R$, then $R$ is called a _commutative ring_.
> __zero divisor__: an nonzero element $a\in R$ is called a _left zero divisor_ if there exists a nonzero element $x$ such that $ax=z$. similarly, $a\in R,\,a\neq z$ is called a _right zero divisor_ if there exists a nonzero element $x$ such that $xa=z$.
> __unity(multiplicative identity)__: let $(R,+,\cdot)$ be a ring. if an element $u\in R$ is such that $u\neq z$ and $au=ua=a,\forall a\in R$, we call $u$ an _unity_ ,or _multiplicative identity_, of $R$. here $R$ is called a _ring with unity_.
> __multiplicative inverse, unit__: let $R$ be a ring with unity $u$. if $a\in R$ and there exists $b\in R$ such that $ab=ba=u$, then $b$ is called _multiplicative inverse_ of $a$ and $a$ is called a _unit_ of $R$. ($b$ is also a _unit_ of $R$ )
> __integral domain__: $R$ is commutative ring with unity. $R$ is called an _integral domain_ if $R$ has no porper divisors of zero.
> __field__: $R$ is commutative ring with unity. $R$ is called a _field_ if every nonzero element of $R$ is a unit.
> ! we will later prove _integral domain_ is a necessary condition to _field_

## 14.2
> __theorem__: in any ring $(R,+,\cdot)$,
> (a) the zero element is unique,
> (b) the additive in inverse of each ring element is unique.
> __cancellation laws of addition__: $\forall a,b,c\in R$,
> (a) $a+b=a+c\Rightarrow b=c$
> (b) $b+a=c+a\Rightarrow b=c$
> __theorem__: for any ring $(R,+,\cdot)$ and any $a\in R$, we have $az=za=z$.
> _proof_: $az=a(z+z)=az+az\Rightarrow az=z$
> __theorem__: given a ring $(R,+,\cdot)$, for all $a,b\in R$,
> (a) $-(-a)=a$
> (b) $a(-b)=(-a)b=-(ab)$
> \(c\) $(-a)(-b)=ab$
> _proof_:
> (b) $a(-b + b)=az=z=a(-b)+ab\Rightarrow a(-b)=-(ab)$
> $(-a+a)b=zb=z=(-a)b+ab\Rightarrow (-a)b=-(ab)$, so $(-a)b=a(-b)=-(ab)$
> __theorem__: for a ring $(R,+,\cdot)$,
> (a) if $R$ has a unity, then it's unique.
> (b) if $R$ has a unity, and $x$ is a unit of $R$, then the multiplicative inverse of $x$ is unique.
> __theorem__: let $(R,+,\cdot)$ be a commutative ring with unity. then $R$ is an integral domain iff for all $a,b,c\in R$ where $a\neq z,ab=ac\Rightarrow b=c$. (namely, a commutative ring with unity that satisifies the _cancellation law of multiplication_ is an integral domain.)
> _proof_: if $R$ is an integral domain and $x,y\in R$, then $xy=z\iff x=z\,or\,y=z$. now if $ab=ac$, then $ab-ac=a(b-c)=z$, and because $a\neq z$, $b-c=z\iff b=c$. conversely, if $R$ is commutative with unity and $R$ satisfies multiplicative cancellation, then let $a,b\in R$ with $a(b-c)=z$. if $a=z$, we finish. if not, as $az=z=a(b-c)$ we conclude that $b-c=z$. so there are no proper divisors of zero, $R$ is an integral domain.
> __! note that the cancellation law of multiplication doesn't imply the existence of multiplicative inverse. for example, $R(\Bbb Z,+,\cdot)$ has only $1$ and $-1$ as unit.__
> __theorem__: if $(F,+,\cdot)$ is a field $\Rightarrow$ $(F,+,\cdot)$ is an integral domain.
> _proof_: let $a,b\in F$ with $ab=z$. if $a=z$, we finish. if not, since $(F,+,\cdot)$ is field, $a$ has an inverse, $a^{-1}$. then $$ab=z\iff ub=a^{-1}z=z\iff b=z$$, so $(F,+,\cdot)$ has no proper divsors of zero and is an integral domain.
> __theorem__: A _finite_ integral domain $(D,+,\cdot)$ is a field.
> _proof_: since $D$ is finite, we may list $D=\{a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_n\}$. for $a_i\in D$ where $a_i\neq z$, we have $a_iD=\{a_ia_1,a_ia_2,a_ia_3,...,a_ia_n\}\subseteq D$ because $D$ is closed under multiplication. now $|D|=n$ and $a_iD\subseteq D\Rightarrow |a_iD|\leq |D|$. if $|a_iD|=n$, $a_iD=D$. if not, $a_ia_j=a_ia_k$, for some $1\leq j\leq k\leq n$. but since $D$ is an integral domain, $a_i\neq z$, $a_j=a_k$, which is contradicted to the first condition. so $a_iD$ must equal $D$ and $a_id_j=u$ for some $1\leq j\leq n$. then $a_id_j=u\Rightarrow a_i$ is a unit of $D$, since $1\leq i\leq n$, it follows that $(D,+,\cdot)$ is a field.
> __subring__: for a ring $(R,+,\cdot)$, a nonempty subset $S$ of $R$ is called a _subring_ of $R$ if $(S,+,\cdot)$ is a ring.
> __EXAMPLE__: for any ring $(R,+,\cdot)$, the subsets $\{z\}$ and $R$ are always subrings of $R$.
> __theorem__: given a ring $(R,+,\cdot)$, a nonempty subset $S$ of $R$ is a subring of $R$ iff
> (1) $a+b,ab\in S,\,\forall a,b\in S$
> (2) $-a\in S,\,\forall a\in S$
> __ideal__: a nonempty subset $I$ of a ring $R$ is called an _ideal_ of $R$ if for all $a,b\in I$ and all $r\in R$, we have $a-b\in I$ and $ar,ra\in I$.
